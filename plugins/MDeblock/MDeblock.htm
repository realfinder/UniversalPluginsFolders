		<P>There are&nbsp;two versions of the plugin, MDeblock.dll the small dynamically 
			linked version and MDeblockS.dll the larger staticly linked version. Install 
			only one version in the Avisynth plugin directory. If MDeblock.dll&nbsp; 
			doesn't work, you have to use MDeblockS.dll or installAvsTimer.dll 
			msvcr71.dll&nbsp;in C:\windows\system32. Inquiries, comments etc. should be 
			posted to&nbsp;the <A href="http://videoprocessing.forumer.com">forum</A>.</P>
		<H2><FONT size="6">Usage</FONT></H2>
		<p>MDeblock should be used as follows&nbsp;
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<P>MDeblock(clip input, string mode, int width, int height, int cwidth, int 
				cheight, leftcrop, topcrop)</P>
		</blockquote>
		<P>
			Here "input" is the clip to be deblocked, "width" (default=8) is the luma block 
			width, "height" (default=8) is the luma block height, "cwidth" (default=8) is 
			the&nbsp;chroma block width, "cheight" (default= 8) is the&nbsp;chroma block 
			height. Finally, if the clip has been cropped before MDeblock and after the 
			block structure has been imposed on the clip by a filter, then you have to 
			specify the sum of all left crop values in the variable "leftcrop" (default=0) 
			and the sum of all top crop values in "topcrop" (default=0). If the user does 
			not crop before MDeblock, he doesn't need to care about "leftcrop" and 
			"topcrop". Under certain circumstances MDeblock is unable to deblock the blocks 
			near the margins if the clip has been cropped before and "leftcrop" , "topcrop" 
			are used. It is very good rule for any Avisynth script to crop as late as 
			possible and there are only very few exceptions from this rule. The default 
			value 8 for "width", height", "cwidth", "cheight" are&nbsp;the&nbsp;right 
			values for progressive clips which are generated&nbsp;by a&nbsp;codec based on 
			the DCT (discrete cosine transformation), like MPEG2 or MPEG4. RemoveDirt has 
			its own&nbsp;deblocking routines (driven by the variables pthreshold, 
			cthreshold), but if you want even more deblocking, you&nbsp;can use 
			MDeblock(cwidth= 4, cheight= 4). Currently MDeblock has&nbsp;five modes 0 (do 
			nothing),1 (MDeblock 0.1),&nbsp; 2 (MDeblock 0.2.1),&nbsp; and the new modes 
			3,4.&nbsp;These modes&nbsp;can be specified for all planes separately with the 
			"mode" string.&nbsp;&nbsp;The "mode" string (default = "222222") consists 
			of&nbsp;6 digits (currently only 0-4 are allowed). The first digit is for 
			hoirzontal deblocking of the luma, the second digit is for vertical deblocking 
			of the luma, the third (resp. the fourth) digit is for hoirzontal (resp. 
			vertical) deblocking of the U plane&nbsp;and finally the fifth (resp. the 
			sixth) digit is for hoirzontal (resp. vertical) deblocking of the&nbsp;V 
			plane.&nbsp;Note that horizontal deblocking deals with vertical edges and 
			vertical deblocking deals with horizontal edges (I have taken over this idiotic 
			notation from MPEG2DEC3 postprocessing). The mode string is&nbsp;particularily 
			useful&nbsp;for interlaced content, because one should never apply vertical 
			deblocking to interlaced content. Thus one should use MDeblock with 
			mode="101010" for field based footage. However, vertical deblocking can be used 
			for interlaced material as well if&nbsp;SeparateFields is applied before. For 
			instance,SeparateFields().MDeblock(cheight= 4).Weave() is the right choice for 
			handling interlaced MPEG2. However, in general it is more reasonable to 
			deinterlace or inverse telecine the video before deblocking.&nbsp;A 
			blur&nbsp;deinterlacer usually takes care of horzontal block edges, because 
			blockiness normally only occures in the presence of motion. Thus only 
			horizontal deblocking (handling vertical edges) is necessary. Actually the 
			deinterlacer RGDeinterlace derived from my RemoveGrain package usually deblocks 
			also vertical edges. Thus deblocking is primarily useful for progressive 
			content. If image quality should be maximised, then one should deblock as early 
			as possible. If compression is an issue one should deblock as late as possible 
			and one won't&nbsp;loose much image quality either. Especially if the clip 
			originates from a DCT codec and is processed by block based filters like 
			PixieDust or RemoveDirt, which share&nbsp;a similar&nbsp;block grid with the 
			codec, deblocking should occure after these filters but before cropping. 
			RemoveDirt has&nbsp;8x8 blocks for the luma&nbsp; and 4x4 blocks for the YV12 
			chroma, while DCT codecs 8x8 for both the luma and the chroma in the 
			progressive case and 8x4 chroma blocks in the interlaced case.
		</P>
		<P>
			Currently only YV12 issupported, but I could easily add the planar color spaces 
			used in RemoveGrain/RemoveDirt and with some restrictions and more work also 
			the interleaved color spaces.
			<H2><FONT size="6">How MDeblock works</FONT></H2>
		<P>Let x1 be a pixel on the left edge of a block, x2 a pixel on the right side of 
			this edge. The pixel x2 already belongs to the neighbour block. Let 
			further&nbsp;x0 be the&nbsp;left neighbour of the pixel x1 and x3 be the right 
			neighbour of the pixel x2. Blockiness becomes visible for the human eye if the 
			(luma) difference |&nbsp;x1 - x2| is fairly large compared with the differences 
			|x0 - x1|, |x2 - x3|. A deblocking filter then must change at least the <EM>edge&nbsp;pixels</EM>
			x1, x2 such that this imbalance disappears. MDeblock with mode=1 changes only 
			the edge pixels. Only the edge pixels should be changed by a deblocking filter. 
			The interior pixels of a block should not be changed. With MDeblock we persue 
			the following strategy. If x1 &lt; x2, then we put&nbsp;a&nbsp;= x1 - |x0 - 
			x1|,&nbsp;b = x2 + |x3 - x2|, y1 = (2*a + b)/3 and y2 = (a + 2*b)/3. Now 
			MDeblock replaces x1 by y1 if&nbsp; x1 &lt; y1, otherwise x1 remains unchanged, 
			it also replaces x2 by y2, if y2 &lt; x2, otherwise x2 remains unchanged. 
			Similarily, if&nbsp;x1 &gt; x2,&nbsp;&nbsp;then we put&nbsp;a&nbsp;= x1&nbsp;+ 
			|x0 - x1|,&nbsp;b = x2&nbsp;- |x3 - x2|, y1 = (2*a + b)/3, y2 = (a + 2*b)/3 
			and&nbsp;MDeblock replaces x1 by y1 if&nbsp; x1&nbsp;&gt; y1,&nbsp;x2 by y2, if 
			y2&nbsp;&gt; x2, Thus in any case the difference of the edge pixels is 
			shrinking. In the extreme cases x0 &lt; x1 &lt; x2 &lt; x3&nbsp;and 
			x0&nbsp;&gt; x1&nbsp;&gt; x2&nbsp;&gt; x3&nbsp;we even have |x0 - y1| = |y1 - 
			y2| = |y2 - x3| if |x0 - x1| &lt;= |x1 - x2| and |x2 - x3| &lt;= |x1 - x2|. The 
			above describtion is only the basic idea, the actual implementation is more 
			sophisticated and considerably more conservative. For instance,&nbsp; the 
			changes made by MDeblock are limited by |x0&nbsp;- x3|. In particular, if 
			x0=x3, then x1 and x2 remain unchanged. It also operates&nbsp;more 
			consrevatively&nbsp;&nbsp;if only one&nbsp;edge pixel&nbsp;is changed.&nbsp;</P>
		<P>MDeblock distinguishes itself from most other deblockers by being based on clear 
			mathematical principles.
		</P>
		<P>Currently MDeblock is a pure C implementation. It can be SSE optimised, though. 
			However, SSE optimisation will only yield a performance gain of 100-200% with 
			SSE and 150-300% with SSE2, because it involves a lot of branching, which 
			degrades the advantages of SIMD prrogramming. With SIMD programming unlike 
			standard programming always all branches have to be executed. In the horizontal 
			case data arrangement is also quite hostile to SSE programming. Thus I will 
			only do SSE optimisation if MDeblock proves to be really useful.
