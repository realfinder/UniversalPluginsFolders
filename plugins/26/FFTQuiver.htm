	  <p> FFTQuiver plugins for Avisynth 2.5+ and 2.6 versions are  free for use, under GPL
	  with no gaurentees or warranties neither
	   explicit nor implied. Use of this plugin is  entirely at users risk.	   
	    </p>	   
	  
	  <p> FQuiver and FFTQuiver plugins are similar except that FQuiver is self contained
	  while FFTQuiver <b>requires</b><a href="http://www.avisynth.nl/users/vcmohan/libfftw3f-3.zip">libFFTw3f-3.dll</a> 
	  or  <a href="http://www.avisynth.nl/users/warpenterprises#fftw3">FFTw3.dll</a>
	  or fftw.dll, and is faster. FFTQuiver plugin has two 
	  functions: <a href="F1Quiver.htm">F1Quiver</a>, <a href="F2Quiver.htm">F2Quiver</a>.
	  .
	   <BR><a href="F1Quiver.htm">F1Quiver</a> transforms image
	  data row by row into one dimensional spatial frequency domain.<BR> 
	   <a href="F2Quiver.htm">F2Quiver</a> as the name  implies converts whole 
	   of image through a 2d transform into spatial frequency domain.<BR>
	  
	  <p><a href="F1Quiver.htm">F1Quiver</a> and <a href="F2Quiver.htm">F2Quiver</a>
	   functions have test facilty for frequency spectral display, and 
	   
	   a large number of cascadable frequency domain Gaussian and 
	  Butterworth filters for image processing. Homomorphic filtering can also be done
	  with these two functions. YUY2 and all Planar (Yv12 only in 2.5 version) color formats only are supported
	  by these  functions.</p>
	  
	  <p>A quiver is a carrying case of a bunch of arrows used by hunters in olden
	  times. As this plugin has a large number of filters, this name was chosen. I am
	  reminded of an excellent book titled 'A quiver full of arrows ' by Jeffry Archer.</p>
	  
	  <p>Comments, suggestions and bug reports may please be addressed to me by 
	  either <a href="mailto:mohanvc@gmail.com">mohanvc</a> or through the 
	  excellent doom9 forum avisynth usage threads.</p>
