Smooth Deinterlace
------------------
SmoothDeinterlace.dll contains an adaptive deinterlacer plugin for AVISynth
(http://www.avisynth.org).  It is based on Gunnar Thalin's SmoothDeinterlace
plugin (http://www.guthspot.se/video/#deinterlacesmooth) for VirtualDub
(http://www.virtualdub.org).

Original port to AVISynth 2.0 (from Xesdeeni2001) you can find here:

Original text by  Xesdeeni:

Version 1.4
-----------
- Fixed another exception when using MPEG2DEC.dll as input.

Features:
- Added new argument called logfile, that allows specification of the log
  file name.

Version 1.3
-----------
- Fixed distortion when cropping before this filter

Version 1.2
-----------
- tff now works correctly for streams which misreport their polarity

Features:
- Top field first (tff) now defaults to the polarity indicated by the
  input stream.  It can be overridden by the tff= argument.

Version 1.1
-----------
- Fixed an exception when using MPEG2DEC.dll as input.

Version 1.0
-----------
Features:
- Fast, area-based deinterlacing
- Programmable edge detection to help eliminate false deinterlacing
- Programmable static interframe detection to help eliminate false
  deinterlacing
- Color coded mode to show deinterlacing during parameter tweeking
- Log file to track interlaced frames (programmable percentage threshold)
- Works in RGB or YUV color spaces
- Works with interlaced frames or successive field input
- Can provide output at the input frame rate (like Gunnar's Area-Based
  Deinterlace plugin for VirtualDub) or double the frame rate (like the
  Smooth Deinterlace plugin for VirtualDub)
- All parameters are optional

Parameters (liberally stolen from Gunnar's description):
lacethresh = (integer; default = 24) Controls the detection of interlace
             patterns.  Lower values deinterlace more.
edgethresh = (integer; default = 20) It's difficult to distinguish between
             interlace lines and real edges (which should not be deinterlaced).
             This value controls this decision. Higher value leaves more edges
             intact.
staticthresh = (integer; default = 35) The filter tries to detect static areas
               to avoid deinterlacing fine details which could result in
               flickering.  This value controls how much a pixel can vary and
               still be called static.  Use the lowest value as possible to
               avoid leaving interlace patterns.  Values above 50 (or so) are
               not recommended.  Good quality video can use lower values.  If
               you don't have any text or logos that may flicker I suggest
               using very low values.  0 makes it work like version 1.0 of the
               VirtualDub plugin.
staticavg = (integer; default = 80) Controls how long the history is when
            determining if areas are static or not.  Low values (short history)
            find static items quckily (but may be incorrect, leaving interlace
            patterns).  High values mean static details may flicker for a
            longer time before stabilizing.  Also, it can be slower to react
            when areas go from static to non-static.  Valid range is 0-100. A
            good rule is to set static averaging >= 2 * static threshold, or
            higher (but don't get too close to 100).
tff = (boolean; default = polarity of input stream) Indicates whether the top
      field occurred first in time.  DV is normally bottom field first
      (tff=false), while (interlaced) DVD is normally top field first
      (tff=true).
doublerate = (boolean; default = false) Determines whether the output is to be
             at double the input frame rate (the field rate) or the same.
             Which one you want will depend on your intended use.
blend = (boolean; default = false) Blends this and previous field in interlaced
        areas. (You should probably avoid using this as it just blurs the
        video.)
showlace = (boolean; default = false) Areas are colored differently to help you
           find suitable parameter values.
           Red - Deinterlaced areas
           Blue - Non-static areas that would be deinterlaced if interlace patterns
                  were found
           Green - Static areas that do contain interlace patterns but are still
                   left untouched
           Grey - Static areas without interlace patterns
log = (boolean; default = false) The frames that have an interlaced area
      exceeding the given number of percent (logpercent) are logged to a file
      which will be placed in the current directory.  It's called
      "DeinterlaceSmooth.log" and contains frame numbers and the interlaced
      area (in %) for each frame.
logpercent = (floating point number; default = 0.0)  See log above.
logfile = (string; default = "DeinterlaceSmooth.log") Used to specify a name for
          the log file.

Usage:
LoadPlugin("SmoothDeinterlacer.dll")
AVISource("Test.avi")
SmoothDeinterlace()

or

LoadPlugin("SmoothDeinterlacer.dll")
AVISource("Test.avi")
SmoothDeinterlace(tff=true, doublerate=true)

Background
----------
I originally searched for an adaptive deinterlacer to assist me in doing
standards conversion (PAL->NTSC & NTSC->PAL; see below).  I tried several,
but I found Gunnar Thalin's Area-Based Deinterlacer plugin for VirtualDub
(http://home.bip.net/gunnart/video/#deinterlacearea) to be the best.

I used AVISynth's support of VirtualDub plugins to create an AVISynth script
that would do the standards conversion for me
(http://www.vcdhelp.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=90816).  The results were
quite good!

However, I had to work around the fact that the Area-Based Deinterlacer only
output at the same frame rate as the input.  (I also had to work around an
AVISynth bug in ChangeFPS(), which has been fixed as of version 2.0.6.)
The technique I used for the standards conversion required that I get double
the frame rate from the deinterlacer.  This was not an option for any
VirtualDub plugin, so I decided to port the deinterlacer to an AVISynth
plugin, which would support a modification to deliver frames at double the
input rate.

After getting this working, I also decided to modify the code to support the
YUV format.  This made sense, since most sources are in YUV.  It also sped
up the operation of the deinterlacer, because it removed an internal conversion
to luminance that was now not necessary.  My conversions were now taking half
the time they had taken before!

I wanted to update the standards conversion script for anyone interested, but
this involved providing the modified deinterlacer as well.  With this in mind,
I contacted Gunnar.  He was very gratious, but pointed out that his new Smooth
Deinterlacer was better and it also output at double the input frame rate.  I
gave it a try and found that it was what I was looking for.  However, I was now
spoiled by the extra speed of the AVISynth, YUV version.  So I then undertook
porting the Smooth Deinterlacer to AVISynth.

Along the way, I made a few minor modifications to the operation.  I added a
switch to allow the output to be either at the frame rate or at double the
frame rate.  I also adapted the field polarity issues Gunnar faced in VirtualDub
to the different environment in AVISynth.  And I did some trickery to remove the
requirement that the input be sequential fields (it will actually take fields
or frames).

But the baseline algorithm, and indeed most of the actual lines of code, were
liberally stolen from Gunnar's source :-)  So although I can be held responsible
for the AVISynth port, please give Gunnar all due credit for the algorithm
itself.

Standards Conversion
--------------------
I had initially intended to segregate my particular use for this deinterlacer
from the deinterlacer itself.  But at Gunnar's urging, I'm including the
standards conversion scripts below.  I will release a bit more user-friendly
version separately, but this will get the more technical of you on your way.

NOTE 1: These scripts are meant to convert truly interlaced (or hybrid) video.
You will achieve MUCH higher quality with progressive content (film) using
other methods.  See vcdhelp.com or doom9.net for guides.

NOTE 2: I prefer ChangeFPS() when going from PAL to NTSC.  This AVISynth filter
replicates frames to achieve the new frame rate.  This is faster than the
ConvertFPS() filter, and it does not introduce the "jutter" common to much
converted video, caused by blending of adjacent fields.  It does cause a stutter
due to the replicated frame (actually, a field), but as hard as I try, I cannot
see it.  This may be because those of us that watch NTSC are used to the 3:2
pulldown conversion of film to video, which contains the same type of stutter.
However, when converting from NTSC to PAL, ChangeFPS() drops frames.  This is
much less desirable, so I recommend ConvertFPS() when converting in this
direction.  Perhaps my PAL-land based friends can take a look for themselves and
let me know what they think.
