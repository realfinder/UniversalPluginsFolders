Function:
 Dropout remover, removes white/black noise horizontal streaking in
 analogue captures. Spatio-Temporal.

Usage instructions.

Assumes TFF (top field first) field order interlacing.

YUY2 only.

Syntax is: DePulse(clip, h=180[0-255], l=60[0-255], d=30[0-255], debug=false[true/false])


Pixel brightness values greater than h (high) are targeted as white noise.
	If a pixel (t) is target'ed as white noise then surrounding pixels
	(above, below, before and after [temporal], Not left and right) are tested
	and if ALL of them are less than (t - d) the target pixel t is
	depulsed.

Pixel brightness values less than l (low) are targeted as black noise.
	If a pixel (t) is target'ed as black noise then surrounding pixels
	(above, below, before and after [temporal], Not left and right) are tested and
	if ALL of them are greater than (t + d) the target pixel t is
	depulsed.

In debug mode, pixels judged to be black or white noise are coloured pink or green.
