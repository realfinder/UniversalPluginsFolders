		<P>There are&nbsp;three versions of the plugin. Firstly there 
			is&nbsp;ReduceFlicker.dll, which requires only an integer SSE capable cpu 
			and&nbsp;there&nbsp;are the ReduceFlickerSSE2.dll 
			ReduceFlickerSSE3.dll&nbsp;&nbsp;for SSE2 and SSE3 capable CPUs. Because 
			ReduceFlickerSSE3.dll had to be compiled with the Intel compiler, there are 
			compatibility issues of this plugin with other filters, but I use it 
			personally.&nbsp;If you are not sure about the properties of your cpu, the 
			freeware utility <A href="http://www.cpuid.org/cpuz.php" target="_blank">CPU-Z</A>
			will help you. Install only one version of the above plugin in the Avisynth 
			plugin directory and make sure that there is no more any old version in the 
			plugin directory. All three versions of the plugin are dynamically linked and 
			require msvcr71.dll&nbsp;(for Microsoft specific stuff) and <A href="http://www.avsrecursion.de.tf" target="_blank">
				AvsRecursion.dll</A> (for recursion within Avisynth). If none of the above 
			dlls works, probably one of these two libraries is missing. They should usually 
			be installed&nbsp;in C:\windows\system32. Inquiries, comments etc. should be 
			posted to&nbsp;the <A href="http://videoprocessing.forumer.com" target="_blank">support 
				forum</A>. Registration is not necessary for posting and browsing in this 
			forum,&nbsp;but it&nbsp;is certainly appreciated. Only in exceptional cases you 
			should send me email. If you do that you must put the word "Avisynth" in the 
			email header, because all other email is discarded (I receive hundreds of spam 
			emails per day to the above address). I also check this email address 
			only&nbsp;every&nbsp;second&nbsp;week. Thus the forum is really the best way 
			for getting support.</P>
		<H2><FONT size="6">Overview</FONT></H2>
		<P>The plugin contains three filters, ReduceFlicker, ReduceFluctuation and 
			LockClense.&nbsp;ReduceFluctuation was previously part of the SSETools plugin, 
			but because it serves a similar purpose as ReduceFlicker, it was moved to this 
			plugin. LockClense is essentially the implementation of an idea of Ralph 
			Boecker.&nbsp;All three&nbsp;filters are purely temporal and can be used for 
			all color spaces including the planar color spaces introduced in <A href="http://www.RemoveGrain.de.tf" target="_blank">
				RemoveGrain</A>. As purely temporal filters&nbsp;both filters&nbsp;can be 
			used for all kind of material, but&nbsp;they are particularily useful for 
			interlaced footage or progressive videos from digicams like my Canon Powershot 
			S1 IS.&nbsp;They should be applied <EM>before</EM> deinterlacing. If done so, 
			the motion detection of the deinterlacer is&nbsp;fooled less by flicker, whence 
			more detail is preserved.
		</P>
		<H2><FONT size="6">ReduceFlicker</FONT></H2>
		<p>ReduceFlicker should be used as follows&nbsp;
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<P>ReduceFlicker(clip input, int "strength", bool "aggressive", bool "grey", bool 
				"planar")</P>
		</blockquote>
		<P>Here "input" is the clip to be processed. With the "strength" variable (default 
			= 2) one can specify&nbsp;the strength of&nbsp;ReduceFlicker. Higher values 
			mean more aggressive operation. Currently&nbsp;three values 1,2,3 are allowed 
			for "strength". If grey = true (false is the default value), then only the luma 
			plane is processed. The other planes contain random garbage. Thus the internal 
			filter greyscale() has to be applied later. The variable "grey" is only used 
			for planar color spaces. If you use planar YUY2, RGB24, RGB32, then you have to 
			set "planar=true" (false is the default value).&nbsp;
		</P>
		<P>ReduceFlicker(strength=1) makes use of 4 frames, the current frame, the 
			subsequent frame and the two predecessors. Consequently, the first 
			two&nbsp;frames and the last frame are left unchanged, because&nbsp;not 
			all&nbsp;three neighbours are available for these frames. 
			ReduceFlicker(strength=2) uses 5 frames, the current frame, the two sucessors 
			and the two predecessors. Finally ReduceFlicker(strength=3) uses&nbsp;7 frames, 
			the current frame, the three sucessors and the three predecessors. Increasing 
			"strength" makes ReduceFlicker more aggressive and slower. Beginning with 
			version 0.5 the boolean variable "aggressive" (default value = false) has been 
			introduced. If aggressive= true, then a significantly more aggressive variant 
			of the algorithm is selected (the speed is the same as with aggressive=false).
		</P>
		<P>ReduceFlicker performs <EM>controlled </EM>averaging of a frame with its two 
			adjacent temporal neighbours. <EM>Controlled</EM> means that averaging only 
			takes place in the presence of oscillations.&nbsp;Without such a&nbsp;restraint 
			the filter would creat massive&nbsp;ghosts. To explain the algorithm in more 
			detail, let c be the luma value of a pixel, p1, p2,p3 its temporal predecessors 
			and n1,n2,n3 its temporal successors. Thus&nbsp;the values are observed in the 
			sequence p3,p2,p1,c,n1,n2,n3. Then ReduceFlicker(strength=1) calculates d = |c 
			- p2|,&nbsp;&nbsp;a = max(c, min(p1, n1) - d), b = min(c, max(p1, n1)&nbsp;+ d) 
			and clips the&nbsp;average (p1 + n1 +2*c)/4 at a,b, i.e. c is replaced by 
			max(b, min((p1 + n1 +2*c)/4, a)). Note that we alwayshave a &gt; = c &gt; = b 
			and that always either a = c or b= c.&nbsp;When &nbsp;|n1 -n2| or d= |c - p2| 
			is large then we even have a = b = c. To illustrate the above&nbsp;formulas, 
			let us look at some examples. The input sequence 10, 20, 10, 20, 10, 20 is 
			converted into 10,20,15,15,15,20. The first two and the last value remain 
			unchanged, while in the middle the oscillations are averaged away. 
			This&nbsp;was the ideal case. If we have the less regular 11,21, 9, 20, 12, 19 
			then ReduceFlicker yields 11,21,15,15,16,19. On the other hand 11,13,9, 
			20,12,19 yields 11,13,9,19,16,19. The third and the fourth member are changed 
			very much, because there is not enough oscillation. If strength&nbsp;&gt; 
			1&nbsp;only the value of d is changed it may become smaller. More precisely we 
			have d = min(|c - p2|,&nbsp;&nbsp;|c - n2|) if strength = 2 and d = min(|c - 
			p2|,&nbsp;&nbsp;(|c - p3|,&nbsp;&nbsp;|c - n2|,&nbsp;&nbsp;|c - n3|) ). From 
			the above definition of a and&nbsp;b it follows that the <EM>clipping band</EM> 
			gets smaller as the value of d increases. Thus as d gets larger, averaging is 
			reduced more and more. The clipping band spanned by a and b also gets smaller 
			if |min(p1, n1) - max(p1, n1)| = |p1 - n1| gets larger, whence ReduceFlicker 
			only generates significant averaging if d and |p1 - n1| are small. In other 
			words the value of a pixel has to alternate three times within a sequence of 
			four frames to get averaged, if strength = 1,2 and within a sequence of five 
			frames if strength = 3. This is the key idea, which evolved from a long 
			thinking process about flicker. So far we have described ReduceFlicker if 
			aggressive=false. If aggressive=true, then the important correction term d in 
			the definition of a and b, which is very important to prohibit artifacts, is 
			replaced by two smaller terms. If strength=1 and aggressive=true, then we 
			define d1 = max(0, p2 - c), d2 = max(0, c - p2), a = max(c, min(p1, n1) - d1), 
			b = min(c, max(p1, n1)&nbsp;+ d2). Note that d = d1 + d2 and that either d1=0 
			or d2=0. Similarily, if strength=2 and aggressive= true, then we define d1 = 
			max(0, min(p2 - c, n2 - c)), d2 = max(0, min(c - p2, c - n2)), and if 
			strength=3 and aggressive= true, then we define d1 = max(0, min(p2 - c, n2 - c, 
			p3 - c, n3 - c)), d2 = max(0, min(c - p2, c - n2, c - p3, c - n3)). We do not 
			recommend to combine strength=3 with aggressive=true.</P>
		<P>The type of flicker, which can be removed or at least reduced with 
			ReduceFlicker, is more prevalent in camcorder material and the chroma of analog 
			clips, especially clips captured from VHS tapes. In other words ReduceFlicker 
			is suited for removing or reducing certain kinds of electronic noise, but it 
			has virtually no effect on dust and film grain.
		</P>
		<P>Unlike most other purely temporal filters like the "cheap" ReduceFluctuation 
			filter below, ReduceFlicker doesn't impose any limitation on the amount of 
			change. Theoretically this bears a substantial artifact risk. The worst case 
			scenario for ReduceFlicker is a lamp which is turned on and off 25 times per 
			second within a PAL video. Obviously this is not very natural and quite rare. 
			It is more natural if a regular pattern, like a fence, is moving at a constant 
			speed within a video. If the spatial properties of this pattern fits well to 
			its speed, then this pattern gets blurred by ReduceFlicker. However, the 
			likelihood of such a "fit" is&nbsp;extremely low if strength = 1,2. It is 
			far&nbsp;higher, but still tolerable, &nbsp;if strength =3. It can be nicely 
			compared with the physical phenomenon of resonance. We all learn at school, 
			that if a large group of soldiers marches in step over a bridge, the bridge may 
			crash. While theoretically possible, I never heart about such an event, because 
			the step frequency and the resonance frequency of the bridge, which depends on 
			its size,&nbsp;have to be very close.

		<P>ReduceFluctuations should be used as follows&nbsp;
		</P>
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P>ReduceFluctuations(clip input, clip "previous", clip "next",&nbsp; int "limit", 
				int "limitU", int "limitV", int "limitA",&nbsp;int "recursive", bool "planar")</P>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P>The role of the variables "input" and "planar" are the same as for 
			ReduceFlicker. The role of the clip variables "previous", "next" is the same 
			as&nbsp;for the filter "Clense" (contained in <A href="http://www.RemoveGrain.de.tf" target="_blank">
				RemoveGrain</A>
		) .With the variable "limit" (default = 5)&nbsp;one can specifiy the maximum 
		amount of change of the luma. Similarily,&nbsp;one can specify with "limitU", 
		"limitV" the maximum amount of change of the U and the V values. "limitU" 
		inherits the value of "limit" as the default value and "limitV" inherits the 
		value of "limitU" as the default value. If limitV &gt; 255, then the V channels 
		is replaced by random values. If limitV &gt; 255 and limitU &gt; 255, then the 
		entire chroma is replaced by random values. This is useful for b&amp;w video. 
		Of course, Greyscale() has to be applied later. For an RGB color space 
		"limit"is for blue channel, "limitU" is for the green channel and "limitV" is 
		for the red channel, but it may also be the other way round. "limitA" is the 
		limit for the fourth channel&nbsp;of the&nbsp;RGB32 color space (it is only 
		used, if planar = false). For interleaved RGB24 (i.e. planar = false)clips the 
		values of&nbsp; "limitU" and "limitV" are ignored and the value of "limit" is 
		taken instead. This was necessary because&nbsp;an efficient SSE 
		implementation&nbsp;is not possible with interleaved pixels of size 3.
		<P>ReduceFluctuations makes use of&nbsp;three frames, the current, the subsequent 
			and the previous frame. Consequently, the first&nbsp;and the last frame are 
			left unchanged, because&nbsp;only one of the&nbsp;neighbours&nbsp;is available 
			for these frames. If recursive&gt;=0 (-1 is the default), then instead of the 
			previous frame, the previously processed frame from a <EM>recursion clip </EM>is 
			taken,&nbsp;if&nbsp;the frames are requested sequentially, as it usually 
			happens during an encoding process and&nbsp;if a recursion clip 
			is&nbsp;assigned later with AssignRecursionClip to the recursion slot specified 
			with the variable "recursive". AssignRecursionClip is contained in <A href="http://www.AvsTimer.de.tf" target="_blank">
				AvsTimer</A> version 0.8 or later. For instance,
			<TABLE id="Table1" bgColor="#b6c0ca" border="1">
				<TR>
					<TD><PRE>input=ReduceFluctuations(recursive = 7) 
AssignRecursionClip(input,7)
return input					</PRE>
					</TD>
				</TR>
			</TABLE>
			reserves the recursion slot 7 (values between 0 and 9 are allowed here) and 
			assigns the output of ReduceFluctuation as the recursion clip for 
			ReduceFluctuations. This was the default behaviour of ReduceFluctuations 
			version 0.3. The following example is more sophisticated:
			<TABLE id="Table2" bgColor="#b6c0ca" border="1">
				<TR>
					<TD><PRE>input=ReduceFluctuations(recursive = 7).RemoveGrain(mode = 17)
AssignRecursionClip(input7)
return input				</PRE>
					</TD>
				</TR>
			</TABLE>
			Now the output of ReduceFluctuations(recursive = 7).RemoveGrain(mode = 17) is 
			used as recursion clip. For more information about recursion see section <EM>The 
				delay filter and AssignRecursionClip </EM>of the <A href="http://www.avstimer.de.tf" target="_blank">
				AvsTimer documentation </A>
		.
		<P>ReduceFluctuations is just a limited version of the very simple filter Clense 
			(cf. <A href="http://www.RemoveGrain.de.tf" target="_blank">RemoveGrain</A>). 
			In fact, it is a combination of Clense and the filter LimitChange from the 
			SSETools plugin. It is slightly slower than Clense but significantly faster 
			than the combination of Clense and LimitChange. Because Clense can be very 
			destructive, limitation is absolutely necessary and the values for limit, 
			limitU, limitV, limitA should never be &gt; 10. Even the default value 5 may be 
			too big.
		</P>
		<H2><FONT size="6">LockClense</FONT></H2>
		<P>LockClense&nbsp;should be used as follows&nbsp;
		</P>
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P>LockClense(clip input,&nbsp; int "limit", int "limitU", int "limitV", int 
				"limitA",&nbsp;bool "clense", int "recursive", bool "planar")</P>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P>The boolean variable "clense" will be explained later. The role of the other 
			variables of LockClense is very similar to the role of the corresponding 
			variables in ReduceFluctuations.&nbsp; To explain how LockClense works, let c 
			be luma of a pixel in the current frame, p be the luma of the same pixel in the 
			previous frame and n be the luma of the same pixel in the subsequent frame. If 
			|c - p| &lt;= limit, then LockClense replaces c by p. Otherwise, if |c - n| 
			&lt;= 2*limit, then LockClense replaces c by (c + n)/2 (actually we take a more 
			sophisticated &nbsp;unbiased average). Finally, if neither |c - p| &lt;= limit 
			nor |c - n| &lt;= 2*limit, then LockClense does the same as ReduceFluctuations 
			(with the same limit). The U channel and the V channel are handled the same 
			way, but with limitU and limitV instead of limit. If "clense= false" (true is 
			the default value of this variable), then ReduceFluctuations is not applied. 
			Thus in this case c remains unchanged if neither |c - p| &lt;= limit nor |c - 
			n| &lt;= 2*limit. If clense= false, then LockClense has much more 
			discontinuities, which have a negative impact on compression. &nbsp;Thus we do 
			not recommend this mode, which is similar to the DNR1 mode of the DNR2 
			filter.&nbsp;The values for limit, limitU, limitV should be &lt;= 5 to avoid 
			artifacts (2 is the default value).
