		<h3>An Avisynth 2.5x filter package for denoising and removing grain from film

		<P>The binary package contains&nbsp;four versions of RemoveGrain, two small 
			dynamically linked versions RemoveGrain.dll, RemoveGrainSSE2.dll, 
			RemoveGrainSSE3.dll&nbsp; and the big staticly linked 
			RemoveGrainS.dll.&nbsp;The first one only requires integer SSE (Athlon 
			and&nbsp;Pentium 3 design), the second requires a SSE2 capable cpu (Pentium 4 
			or Athlon 64) and the third is for Prescott P4s only. If none of these dlls 
			work because of a missing dll, one has either to copy the missing dll to the 
			window's system directory or one has to use RemoveGrainS.dll, which only 
			requires SSE. Please put only one of the three plugins into the Avisynth plugin 
			directory. RemoveGrain supports all color spaces. YV12 is directly supported 
			and YUY2, RGB24, RGB32 are supported in planar form (see the section Color 
			Spaces).&nbsp;Beginning with version 0.6 the auxiliary filter Clense has been 
			added to RemoveGrain.dll and the plugin Repair.dll has been added to the binary 
			package. There are again four versions of this 
			plugin.&nbsp;Though&nbsp;Repair.dll is derived from the same source code, it 
			serves for quite different purposes. This plugin contains the filters Repair 
			and TemporalRepair. All three new filters are described below. Please 
			post&nbsp;questions, problems, comments etc.&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<A href="http://videoprocessing.forumer.com">support 
				forum</A> &nbsp;&nbsp;rather than sending me email.&nbsp;In particular, I 
			would appreciate reports about artifacts and compression gain of the various 
			modes. These may also help others to select the right mode.
		</P>
		<H2><FONT size="6">Application Areas</FONT></H2>
		<P>RemoveGrain&nbsp;has started as&nbsp;a purely spatial denoiser&nbsp;(modes 1-9, 
			17, 18, 21, 22) &nbsp;and over time it has evolved into a general plugin which 
			manipulates a pixel in terms of its eight direct neighbours (and of course the 
			value of the pixel itself). It now includes&nbsp;modes for blurring&nbsp;(11, 
			12, 19, 20), modes for nondestructive sharpening (10, 25), smart bob modes 
			(13-16) and last but not least the modes 23, 24 for removing small edge halos, 
			which may be generated by sharpening filters or by lossy DCT compression. 
			&nbsp;Then from the same source code - with some modifications, of course - the 
			Repair plugin for correcting other filters was derived. It is primarily used 
			for&nbsp;removing artifacts of&nbsp;the&nbsp;very aggressive and simple 
			temporal cleaner Clense&nbsp;(also included in RemoveGrain), but it can also be 
			used for deringing (very different from RemoveGrain mode 23,24) and taming 
			sharpeners. Together with Clense, the filter RestoreMotionBlocks from the <A href="http://www.RemoveDirt.de.tf">
				RemoveDirt</A>&nbsp;plugin it is used to built the RemoveDirt script 
			function - my most powerful cleaner/denoiser. Finally, in the same way as 
			Repair was derived from RemoveGrain, TemporalRepair(mode=0) was derived from 
			Clense and is included in the Repair plugin. TemporalRepair(mode=1,2) are much 
			more sophisticated and slower variants of this filters, which can also be used 
			to converting&nbsp;simple spatial deinterlacers like RemoveGrain(mode=12) into 
			motion adaptive deinterlacers, which fully preserve static detail. Thus 
			deinterlacing is another application area of the RemoveGrain/Repair plugin.
		</P>
		<P>RemoveGrain modes 1-10,17-25&nbsp;are for&nbsp;truely progressive input only, 
			the bob modes 13-16 are for interlaced input only and modes 11,12 can be used 
			both for progressive and interlaced input.&nbsp;Of course, all modes can be 
			used for interlaced input, if the two fields are separated before applying 
			RemoveGrain with the builtin filter SeparateFields and then merged together 
			again,&nbsp;but the quality is clearly inferior, because the&nbsp;adjacent 
			pixels have twice the vertical distance.</P>
		<P>The frame width of the input clip must be&nbsp;&gt; 36 (SSE version) or &gt; 68 
			(SSE2/SSE3 version). The pixels at the margin are never changed, because it 
			would require different algorithms. The SSE3 version can only be compiled with 
			the Intel Compiler and there are compatibility problems, which I haven't 
			tracked down yet. As far as I know this&nbsp;causes only&nbsp;problems 
			if&nbsp;you use Avisource (mpeg2source works well). If you combine Avisource 
			with the SSE3 version of RemoveGrain, VirtualDubMod crashes, when you exit it. 
			For encoders the problem may be more severe. Thus if you experience crashes 
			with the SSE3 version of RemoveGrain, try the SSE2 version. If the problem 
			disappears, then it is again an Intel compiler compatibility problem and should 
			be posted to the support forum. On the other hand, if you have an SSE3 capable 
			cpu you should use the SSE3 version, because it is significantly faster than 
			the SSE2 which is only slightly faster than the standard SSE version.
		</P>
		<H2><FONT size="6">How it works</FONT></H2>
		<P>In modes 1-10,17,18 the value of the center pixel is replaced by the value of 
			one of its eight neighbours. In order to discuss the various modes in full 
			detail the reader must always keep the following picture in mind:
		</P>
		<P>
			<table align="center" bgColor="#cccccc" border="5">
				<tr>
					<td>n(1)</td>
					<td>n(2)</td>
					<td>n(3)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>n(4)</td>
					<td align="center">c</td>
					<td>n(5)</td>

		</P>
		<P>The pixel "c" in the middle is called the center pixel and 
			n(1),n(2),n(3),n(4),n(5),n(6),n(7),n(8) are&nbsp;the eight neighbour pixels. 
			All the modes of RemoveGrain&nbsp;modify the center pixel&nbsp;depending only 
			on&nbsp;the eight neighbours and the center pixel itself. Mode 1 replaces the c 
			by max(min(c, MAX), MIN), where 
			MAX=max(n(1),n(2),n(3),n(4),n(5),n(6),n(7),n(8)) and 
			MIN=min(n(1),n(2),n(3),n(4),n(5),n(6),n(7),n(8)). Thus RemoveGrain(mode=1) is 
			identical with trbarry's <A href="http://www.trbarry.com" target="_blank">Undot</A>
			&nbsp;(even the speed of the SSE version is nearly identical to that of Undot, 
			but the SSE2 and especially the SSE3 versions&nbsp;are significantly 
			faster).&nbsp;Mode 2-4 are more aggressive refinements of mode 1. To this end, 
			let i(1),i(2),i(3),i(4),i(5),i(6),i(7),i(8) be a reordering of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 
			such that n(i(1)) &lt;= n(i(2)) &lt;= n(i(3)) &lt;= n(i(4)) &lt;= n(i(5)) &lt;= 
			n(i(6)) &lt;= n(i(7)) &lt;= n(i(8)). In particular, MIN=n(i(1)) and 
			&nbsp;MAX=n(i(8)). Then mode=k (with k ranging from 1 to 4) replaces the center 
			pixel c by max(min(c,n(9-k)), n(k)). Mode 4 can also be interpreted in terms of 
			the <EM>median</EM>, i.e. mode 4 replaces c by the median of the nine values 
			c,n(1),n(2),n(3),n(4),n(5),n(6),n(7),n(8). As the mode increases (between 1 and 
			4 only) RemoveGrain becomes more and more aggressive. Mode 1-4 are so called <EM>neighbour 
				clipping</EM> modes, i.e.&nbsp;a pair of&nbsp;neighbours n1,n2&nbsp;is 
			selected and&nbsp;c is replaced by&nbsp;max(min(c,max(n1,n2)), min(n1,n2)). In 
			the case of mod k (with k between 1 and 4) n1=n(i(9-k)) and n2=n(i(k)) are 
			selected. In the subsequent discussion, the selected&nbsp;pair n1,n2 is called 
			the <EM>clipping pair</EM>. Mode 1-4 are not <EM>line sensitve, </EM>i.e. 
			the&nbsp;clipping pair n1,n2&nbsp;doesn't need to be a <EM>line pair</EM>. 
			There are four line pairs: the horizontal pair n(4),n(5), the vertical pair 
			n(2),n(7) and the two diagonal pairs n(1),n(8) and n(3),n(6). The modes 5-9,18 
			are line sensitive cliiping modes, i..e. the clipping pair is always a line 
			pair. Mode 9 is the simplest mode of this kind. Here the line pair n1,n2 is 
			chosen such that |n1 - n2| is minimal. In mode 5 the line pair n1,n2 is chosen 
			such that |c - max(min(c,max(n1,n2)), min(n1,n2))| is minimal, i.e. such that 
			the change is minimal. The modes 6,7,8 are intermediate modes between mode 5 
			and mode 9. Mode 6 is closer to mode 5 while&nbsp;mode 8 is closer to mode 9 
			and mode 7 is right in the middle between mode 5 and mode 9.&nbsp;Fizick has 
			extended mode 5-9 to the temporal domain in his plugin <A href="http://bag.hotmail.ru">
				DeGrainMedian</A>. Because there are now&nbsp;13 instead of&nbsp;4 line 
			pairs, DeGrainMedian&nbsp;is necessarily slower. In mode 18 the line pair n1,n2 
			is chosen as the clipping pair&nbsp;if max(|c - n1|, |c - n2|) is minimal. 
			Because of its nice properties discussed further below mode 17 is the most 
			important mode.&nbsp;In mode 17 the&nbsp;clipping pair m1,m2 is chosen such 
			that&nbsp;m1 = max min(n1,n2) and m2=min max(n1,n2), where the maximum and the 
			minimum&nbsp;are taken over all line pairs n1,n2. Note that in mode 17 the 
			clipping pair m1,m2 is not necessarily a line pair. &nbsp;Mode 21,22 are the 
			last denoising modes. These are <EM>not </EM>neighbour<EM> </EM>clipping modes. 
			&nbsp;Instead clipping is done with respect to <EM>averages</EM> of neighbours. 
			In mode 22 clipping is done with respect to&nbsp;MinA = min&nbsp;(n1 + n2 + 
			1)/2, MaxA =&nbsp; max (n1 + n2 + 1)/2, where the minimum and the maximum is 
			taken over all line pairs (n1,n2). This mode is the fasted of all modes, even 
			faster than mode 1. Mode 21 is very similar to mode 22, but with MinA&nbsp;= 
			min&nbsp;(n1 + n2 )/2. Mode 21 is significantly slower than mode 22 but unlike 
			mode 22 it has no upside bias.
		</P>
		<P>Modes 11, 12, 19 and 20 are <EM>blur</EM> modes. Mode 11 replaces the center 
			pixel c by (4*c + 2*n(2) + 2*n(4) + 2*n(5) + 2*n(7) + n(1) + n(3) + n(6) + n(8) 
			+ 8) / 16. It is similar to blur(1),&nbsp;which implements bluring with a (1/4, 
			1/2, 1/4) kernel both in the horizontal and the vertical direction. However, it 
			is significantly more precise. Mode 12 differs from mode 11 by at most 1 but is 
			significantly faster than mode 11. Mode 12 is still more precise than 
			blur(1).&nbsp; Mode 19 replaces c by the average of its&nbsp;8 neighbours. 
			Finally mode 20 replaces c by the uniform average (c + n(1) + n(2) + n(3) + 
			n(4) + n(5) + n(6) + n(7) + n(8) + 4) / 9.&nbsp;
		</P>
		&lt; P&gt; In version 0.7 the two bob modes 13 and 14 have been added. Mode 13 
		leaves the bottom field unchanged and interpolates the top field. Mode 14 
		leaves the top field unchanged and interpolates the bottom field. The 
		interpolation in mode 13, 14 is similar to Trbarry's weird bob, which is part 
		of Trbarry's <A href="http://www.trbarry.com" target="_blank">Tomsmocomp</A>. 
		However, instead of optimising over 5 line pairs we optimise only over&nbsp;3 
		line pairs. More precisely,&nbsp;c is replaced either by (n(2) + n(7)&nbsp; + 
		1)/2 or (n(1) + n(8) + 1)/2 or (n(3) + n(6) + 1)/2, depending on which of 
		the&nbsp;three distances |n(2) - n(7)|,&nbsp;&nbsp;|n(1) - 
		n(8)|,&nbsp;&nbsp;|n(3) - n(6)| is minimal. In Trbarry's weird bob&nbsp;there 
		are two more possible interpolation values,&nbsp;which makes&nbsp;weird bob 
		more edge sensitve, but also the likelihood of smart edge artifacts is higher 
		and of course it is slower. Taking only 3 line pairs seems to be the best 
		compromise to us. Together with the filter TemporalRepair, described below, it 
		may be used for builting motion adaptive&nbsp;deinterlacers. Beginning with 
		version 0.8 we have added modes 15, 16. They have the same edge sensitivity as 
		modes 13,14 but the quality is somewhat higher and the speed somewhat slower.
		<P></P>
		<P>In version 1.0 the modes 23, 24 for removing small edge were added. They are 
			primarily useful for digicam videos, which are loaded with these compression 
			unfriendly artifacts caused by sharpening and DCT. They would also be quite 
			useful for digicam photos. Let us&nbsp;look at a typical example of 6 
			consectuve pixels on a line with the following values: &nbsp;102, 100, 120, 30, 
			50, 51. Thus there is an edge between&nbsp;the third and the fourth pixel. It 
			is very typical for edge halos, that the pixels at the edge are more <EM>extreme, </EM>
			i.e. instead of 100, the third pixel has the value 120 and instead of 50 the 
			fourth pixel has the value 30. Thus on one side we have an overshot on the 
			upside, while on the other side we have an overshot on the downside 
			and&nbsp;both overshots have usually similar size.&nbsp;To describe&nbsp;modes 
			23 and&nbsp;24 we fix a line pair n1,n2 for a while. We may assume that n2 
			&lt;= n1. Then in mode 23 the upside overshot of the line pair (n1,n2) is 
			defined by u(n1,n2) <!--StartFragment --><SPAN class="postbody">= max(min(c-n1, n1 - n2), 0)</SPAN>
			and the downside overshot is defined by d(n1,n2) =&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--StartFragment --><SPAN class="postbody">max(min(n2 - c, n1 - n2), 0)</SPAN>
			. Note that&nbsp;we never can have&nbsp;&nbsp;u(n1,n2) &gt; 0 and d(n1,n2) &gt; 
			0 simultaneously for a line pair (n1,n2). Normally - the artifact free case - 
			we even have u(n1,n2)&nbsp;= d(n1,n2)&nbsp;= 0. To get acquainted with these 
			definitions, let us look at two examples. if n1=100, c=120, n2=30, then 
			u(n1,n2)=max(min(120-100,100-30),0) = 20, d(n1,n2)=max(min(30-120,100-30),0)=0. 
			If n1=120,c=30,n2=50, then u(n1,n2)=&nbsp;Finally the total upside overshot of 
			the center pixel c is defined by U(c)&nbsp;= max u(n1,n2) and the total 
			downside overshot is defined by D(c)&nbsp;= max d(n1,n2). In both case the 
			maximum is taken over all the four line pairs through the pixel c. In bizarre 
			cases, we may very have U(c) &gt; 0 and D(c) &gt; 0 simultaneously, but usually 
			only of the two total overshot numbers is significantly above 0. Finally in 
			mode 23, the center pixel c is replaced by c - U(c) + D(c). Mode 24 only 
			differs from mode 23 by a more sophisticated definition of u(n1,n2) and 
			d(n1,n2). More precisely, the follwing definitions are used in mode 24: 
			u(n1,n2) = max(min(c-n1, 2*n1 - n2 -c), 0), d(n1,n2) =&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--StartFragment --><SPAN class="postbody">max(min(n2 - c, n1 + c - 2*n2), 0)</SPAN>. 
			These modified definitions make mode 24 considerably more conservative and 
			slightly slower than mode 23. Mode 24 should be preferred.
		</P>
		<P>Finally mode 25 is the <EM>minimal sharpening</EM> mode. In this mode the 
			neighbours n1,n2 are selected such that n1 &lt;= c &lt;= n2 and such that there 
			exists no further neighbour n with n1 &lt; n &lt; n2. If c is larger than all 
			neighbours, then n2 doesn't exist. In this case, we simply replace n2 by 255. 
			Similarily, if c is smaller than all neighbours, then n1 doesn't exist and n1 
			is replaced by the value 0. Finally c is sharpened as described in the section 
			Sharpening between two points.
		</P>
		<H2><FONT size="6">Properties of the various modes</FONT></H2>
		<P>All modes, which replace c by a neighbour, preserve and even slightly improve <EM>sharp 
				edges,</EM> but in many modes some pixels may be shaved off the edge. In 
			particular, it is important property whether a RemoveGrain mode preserves the <EM>corners</EM>
			of edges. If the center c is close to <EM>both</EM> points of a line pair 
			(n1,n2), in particular, n1 and n2 are both close to each other as well, then we 
			say that a mode preserves <EM>thin lines</EM> if the modified pixel is again 
			close to n1,n2. This is the most important property, when we measure how well a 
			mode preserves details. Note that preserving thin lines, means only that the 
			interior points of a thin line are preserved, line ends my be shaved off. We 
			say that a mode preserves <EM>line ends,</EM> if the line ends are not shaved 
			off. Preserving thin lines usually implies that also most points of a thin 
			curve are preserved as well, at least if the curve is sufficiently smooth. We 
			say that a mode preserves <EM>thin curves</EM> if it preserves <EM>all </EM>points 
			of the curve except possibly the two ends of the curve. Finally it is 
			important, how well a mode improves <EM>compression. </EM>We have now named all 
			the properties, which are quantified in the following table:</P>

		<P>The entries range from 0 to 10. The higher the number the higher the quality of 
			this property. Since mode 25 even worsens compression slightly the compression 
			entry of mode 25 has the value -1. The numbers itself are primarily based 
			theoretical and sometimes also on discussions in various forums. The 
			compression numbers are underpinned by extensive one pass XviD compression 
			tests with the fixed quantiser 5 with sources either from digital TV or from a 
			digicam.</P>

		<H2><FONT size="6">Optimal Usage</FONT></H2>
		<P>1. As already mentioned, RemoveGrain cannot change border pixels. To get rid of 
			these, cropping should be done <EM>after</EM> RemoveGrain. On the other hand, 
			for RemoveDirt cropping should be done before such that&nbsp;DCT blocks and 
			RemoveDirt blocks are the same. Thus, if RemoveGrain is combined with 
			RemoveDirt cropping should be done at best between RemoveGrain and Removedirt.
		</P>
		<P>2. Although&nbsp;RemoveGrain always makes a lot of unaligned memory 
			access&nbsp;aligning frames&nbsp;nevertheless has a positive performance 
			impact. Thus crop with <EM>align</EM>=true, if you need to crop before 
			RemoveGrain.
		</P>
		<P>3. If mode=0 (resp. modeU=0, resp. modeV=0), then the Y plane (resp. the U 
			plane, resp. the V plane) is simply copied from input to output. If even mode 
			&lt; 0 (resp. modeU &lt; 0, resp. modeV &lt; 0) then for the respective planes 
			nothing is done at all (not even a copy operation).&nbsp;This may be used for 
			faster processing of black&amp;white clips. For instance RemoveGrain(mode=8, 
			modeU= -1).RemoveDirt(grey= true) is the fasted way to process a 
			black&amp;white clip by the RemoveGrain/RemoveDirt combo. Because modeV 
			inherits the value -1 from modeU, RemoveGrain doesn't process the chroma planes 
			and RemoveDirt subsequently sets the chroma planes uniformly to 128. If you use 
			modeU=-1, you must add a chroma later through the builtin filters MergeChroma 
			or GreyScale.
		</P>
		<P>4. RemoveGrain is fairly fast. It makes perfect sense to iterate it for better 
			denoising. For instance, RemoveGrain(mode=2). RemoveGrain(mode=2) is still a 
			fairly defensive denoiser, which doesn't destroy thin lines.
		</P>
		<P>5. If grain is too crude, RemoveGrain can only partially remove it or cannot 
			remove it at all. Because in such a case the source is quite poor anyway, it is 
			a good idea to shrink. Then also the grain gets smaller and RemoveGrain may be 
			able to erase it. In general, downsizing should be done <EM>before </EM>RemoveGrain

		<P>6. As described above, some modes, especially mode 3,4,9, have a thin line 
			problem. Now YUY2 and especially YV12 have a buitlin thin line problem for the 
			chroma, because several pixels share one chroma value. This problem is 
			amplified if RemoveGrain is applied to the chroma.&nbsp;It should be kept in 
			mind, that RemoveGrain has roughly four times the strength, if it is applied to 
			the YV12 chroma rather than the luma. This is the main reason for edge softness 
			caused by the more conservative modes 18,6,7,8,17. Thus to avoid compounding 
			the thin line problem, it is a good idea to use modes without a thin line 
			problem for the chroma even if mode 3,4,9 is used for the luma. For instance 
			RemoveGrain(mode=4, modeU=2) uses the high compression mode 4 for the luma and 
			the low artifact mode 2 for the chroma. On the other hand the chroma is often 
			particularily noisy (especially if the clip originates from a video tape), 
			which speaks against applying a more conservative mode for the chroma.

		<H2><FONT size="6">Clense</FONT></H2>
		<P>Clense uses the same simple cleaning technique as <A href="http://www.RemoveDirt.de.tf">
				RemoveDirt</A></B>, but without any protection against artifacts. 
			Thus,&nbsp;if p[i,j],c[i,j],s[i,j] denotes the luma of the pixel with 
			coordinates i,j on the previous, the current and the subsequent frame, then 
			c[i,j] is replaced by min(max(c[i,j], min(p[i,j],s[i,j])), 
			max(p[i,j],s[i,j]))), i.e. temporal minmax clipping. Clense is a very brutal 
			cleaner and cannot be used without Repair or some other artifact remover. 
			Nevertheless if dirt or grain overlaps with similar dirt or grain on&nbsp;only 
			one&nbsp;adjacent frame, this overlap cannot be cleaned. This remark is 
			particularily important for grain (even invisable grain may have a very 
			significant negative impact on compression). Thus it&nbsp;enhances compression 
			quite a bit to remove this left over. The left over of Clense is usually 
			significantly smaller than the original grain, whence Clense + RemoveGrain is 
			considerably more effective and is able to remove much cruder grain&nbsp;than 
			RemoveGrain alone, but of course there is&nbsp;a severe&nbsp;artifact problem.</P>
		<P>Clense accepts two arguments. The first is the input clip and the second is the 
			boolean variable <EM>grey</EM> (<EM>grey</EM>=false is the default). If 
			grey=true, then there is no chroma processing at all, i.e. the chroma planes 
			contain random values and the greyscale filter has to be applied at some later 
			stage. The grey variable is ignored for clips with color spaces other than 
			YV12.</P>
		<P>Beginning with version 0.9 there are also the filters <STRONG>BackwardClense </STRONG>
			and <STRONG>ForwardClense</STRONG>. They are primarily for clensing at sharp 
			scene changes in the RemoveDirt script function. ForwardClense is for the first 
			frame of a new scene and BackwardClense is for the last frame of a scene. The 
			usage is the same as Clense.
		</P>
		<H2><FONT size="6">Repair</FONT></H2>
		<P>Beginning with version 0.6 we have added the Repair plugin. It is generated from 
			the same source code as RemoveGrain, but serves a very different purpose. 
			Instead of removing grain, Repair should remove artifacts introduced by 
			previous filters. It does so by comparing the video before these filters were 
			applied with the video after application of these filters. Thus Repair requires 
			two clips as input. The first clip is the filtered and the second the 
			unfiltered clip. Otherwise Repair uses the same variables as RemoveGrain, but 
			modes 11-17, which do not make sense for Repair are disabled. Thus there are 
			currently 10 Repair modes.
		</P>
		<P>Repair works very similar as RemoveGrain, but unlike RemoveGrain, where the 
			center pixel and the neighbour pixels are both from the same frame of the clip, 
			in Repair the center pixel (i.e. the pixel to be changed) is taken from the 
			first clip (i.e. the filtered clip) and the neighbour pixels are taken from the 
			second clip (i.e. the&nbsp;unfiltered original&nbsp;clip). For instance 
			Repair(filtered, original, mode= 1)&nbsp;clips the luma of a pixel of the clip 
			"filtered", by the luma minimum and the luma maximum of the neighbour pixels of 
			the pixel in the clip "original". Thus Repair limits the amount of change from 
			clip "original" to the clip "filtered". This is clearly some kind of artifact 
			removal. The higher the mode (from 1 to 4 only) the stronger the artifact 
			removal. With <EM>mode</EM>=4, Repair(filtered, original, mode=4) 
			is&nbsp;fairly close&nbsp;to RemoveGrain(original, mode= 4, limit= 0). As 
			described above the center pixel of the original clip would be ignored. This 
			doesn't make sense. We have therefore made changes to include also the center 
			pixel of the original clip for all Repair modes. For instance, Repair(filtered, 
			original, mode=1) clips the center pixel of the filtered clip by the minimum of 
			all the 8 neighbours and the center pixel of the original clip on one side and 
			by the maximum of all the 8 neighbours and the center pixel of the original 
			clip on the other side. In particular, Repair(input, input, mode=1) doesn't 
			change at all&nbsp;the clip input. Without inlcluding the center pixel of the 
			original clip, Repair(input, input, mode= 1)&nbsp;would have been identical to 
			RemoveGrain(input, mode= 1) or Undot(input). In general, we have 
			RemoveGrain(input, mode=n) = Repair(input, input, n+1) for n=0,1,2,3.
		</P>
		<P>In version 0.9 we have added new Repair modes, which are derived from 
			RemoveGrain modes in a different way. To this end, let "f" be the luma value of 
			the center pixel of the filtered clip (which is to be repaired) and "o" be the 
			luma value of the same pixel in the original. Then as in the corresponding 
			RemoveGrain mode, two neighbour pixels with luma values, say, "n1", "n2" are 
			selected and&nbsp;"f" is clipped at min(n1,n2,o) and max(n1,n2,o). Of course, 
			the chroma is treated the same way. Such a Repair mode can be derived from any 
			RemoveGrain mode except modes 11-16. We have done this for mode 1-6, 17, 18 
			only. 11-18 are the corresponding repair modes. Thus Repair modes 11-16 
			correspond to the RemoveGrain modes 1-6, while Repair modes 17,18 correspond to 
			the RemoveGrain Modes 17,18. For mode 1 both methods for deriving Repair modes 
			coincide, whence Repair(mode=1) and Repair(mode=11) are identical. (Repair mode 
			16 is of particular importance. It restores thin lines and there is good chance 
			(but no guarantee) that even the end points are restored. It is currently the 
			primary Repair mode for the RemoveDirt script.
		</P>
		<P>Let us now discuss some examples for Repair. The first is a preliminary version 
			of <STRONG>RemoveDust</STRONG>:
		</P>
		<P>
			<TABLE id="Table2" bgColor="#b6c0ca" border="1">
				<TR>
					<TD><PRE>function RemoveDust(clip input, int _mode)

					</TD>
				</TR>
			</TABLE>
		</P>
		<P>Firstly Clense brutally removes all temporal dirt but also introduces many 
			artifacts. Repair then removes these artifacts but also restores all bigger 
			pieces of dirt. While most of the motion artifacts from Clense are removed by 
			Repair, motion gets blurred quite a bit, but static areas are not touched. 
			Finally RemoveGrain (I recommend mode=17) removes the left over from Clense. 
			Blurring motion has a much more significant impact on compression than blurring 
			static detail.&nbsp;On the other hand, the human eye can not really concentrate 
			on motion detail and may even get "nervous" from motion details. Thus in my 
			view&nbsp;RemoveDust is much better&nbsp;than the usual "blur all a little" 
			approach of most denoisers.&nbsp; If you want a more a agressive Removedust, 
			you may choose repmode=&nbsp;2,5,1 and/or apply RemoveGrain before Repair. 
			Repair(mode= 9) is very interesting. It restores all thin lines destroyed by 
			clense. Nevertheless its compression is&nbsp;remarkably good (the output size 
			is usailly less than 5%-20% &nbsp;above that with Repair(mode= 2) or 
			Repair(mode= 5) . I recommend to use Repair only with modes 2, 5-9,16,18.&lt; 
			/P&gt; The second example is a high quality deringing filter:
			<TABLE id="Table14" bgColor="#b6c0ca" border="1">
				<TR>
					<TD><PRE>function RGDering(clip input, int _mode)
{
	repmode = 1
	average = RemoveGrain(input, mode=_mode)
	return Repair(input, average, mode=repmode)
}</PRE>
					</TD>
				</TR>
			</TABLE>
			Currently 11,12,4 are the only reasonable values for the variable _mode. 
			_mode=4 is certainly the most aggressive choice. Line preserving modes like 
			_mode = 1,2,5,17,18 should definitely not be used here, because ringing 
			artifacts often occur along lines or curves and RGDering would be unable to 
			catch these artifactsif a line preserving mode was chosen. Note that in 
			RGDering input is the first and not as usual the second clip variable. If 
			repmode=1, then&nbsp;RGDering computes the maximum and the minimum of 
			RemoveGrain(mode=_mode) averages in the 3x3 square around a pixel and clips the 
			original value of this pixel at this minimum and maximum. Repair may also be 
			used to tame sharpeners:

		<H2><FONT size="6">TemporalRepair</FONT></H2>
		<P>In the same way&nbsp;as Repair is derived from RemoveGrain, TemporalRepair is 
			derived from Clense. While Repair is a spatial filter most suitable for 
			removing artifacts of temporal filters like&nbsp;Clense, TemporalRepair is a 
			temporal filter, primarily useful for restoring static (non moving) 
			details&nbsp;of spatial filters like&nbsp;RemoveGrain. Especially 
			RemoveGrain(mode= 4) looses its "washed out" look, if combined with 
			TemporalRepair:
			<TABLE id="Table1" bgColor="#b6c0ca" border="1">
				<TR>
					<TD><PRE>function RemoveTemporalGrain(clip input, int _mode)
{
	rg = RemoveGrain(input, mode=_mode)
	return TemporalRepair(rg, input)
}</PRE>
					</TD>
				</TR>
			</TABLE>
		<P></P>
		<P>mode=4 is definitely recommended for RemoveTemporalGrain. Of course compression 
			of RemoveTemporalGrain(4) output is worse than that of RemoveGrain(mode= 4) but 
			it is well above the more defensive RemoveGrain modes and fully preserves 
			static detail. For RemoveDust the situation is even better:
			<TABLE id="Table5" bgColor="#b6c0ca" border="1">
				<TR>
					<TD><PRE>function RemoveDust(clip input, int _mode)
{
	repmode = 2
	clensed = Clense(input)

	rg = RemoveGrain(rep, mode=_mode)
	return TemporalRepair(rg, rep)
}</PRE>
					</TD>
				</TR>
			</TABLE>
		<P></P>
		<P>Note that instead of the original clip "input", now the intermediate clip "rep" 
			is taken as the second clip. Compared with the previous version of RemoveDust 
			in the current&nbsp;(not yet the final) version&nbsp;RemoveGrain has just been 
			replaced by&nbsp;RemoveTemporalGrain and softness is reduced substantially if 
			mode=4. Static detail even remains untouched and compression doesn't suffer too 
			much. Though the edges of objects are even sharpened, if these objects are not 
			to tiny, RemoveDust looks somewhat soft and tiny moving objects may be whiped 
			out, a good part of the softness is only psychological, because virtually all 
			the natural flicker in a film, which doesn't contain any information, but to 
			which the human eye is quite used to, is removed. If such flicker is 
			reintroduced by a sharpener after decoding by a player (with ffdshow for 
			example), then RemoveDust clips should&nbsp;look quite crisp again.
		</P>
		<P>TemporalRepair can also be used to build a reasonably fast, high compression, 
			threshold free, no motion no change deinterlacer:</P>
		<P>
			<TABLE id="Table6" bgColor="#b6c0ca" border="1">
				<TR>
					<TD><PRE>function RGDeinterlace(clip input)
{
	rg = RemoveGrain(input, mode=12)
	return TemporalRepair(rg, input)
}</PRE>
					</TD>
				</TR>
			</TABLE>
		</P>
		<P>&nbsp;While RemoveGrain(input, mode=12) deinterlaces every pixel, TemporalRepair 
			restores the static areas. This is rather typical for TemporalRepair, if a 
			filter messes up the static parts of a video these can be restored nicely - 
			without any threshold artifacts - by TemporalRepair. RGDeinterlace&nbsp;is a 
			blur deinterlacer, which&nbsp;behaves similar to&nbsp;AlignFields(mode=2) but 
			without any flicker, because there are no thresholds. If on one frame the 
			"motion&nbsp;value" of an area is slightly&nbsp;above the threshold and on the 
			next it is slightly below, then this&nbsp;area is deinterlaced on one frame and 
			unchanged on the other. This usually shows up as flicker, which is typical for 
			threshold based motion adaptive deinterlacers. It has quite negative effects on 
			compression.&nbsp;Unfortunately, in this form RGDeinterlace performs quite 
			badly in my ticker tape test, because TemporalRepair&nbsp;restores to much. 
			Though the artifacts in the ticker tape test are only visable with 400% 
			magnification in VirtualDub, they indicate that the deinterlacer is not 
			compression optimal, i.e. compression is wasted without gaining image quality. 
			To&nbsp;improve the performance in this test&nbsp;I have added the integer 
			variable <EM>smooth</EM> to TemporalRepair in version 0.7. If <EM>smooth</EM>=0, 
			the default value, then TemporalRepair performs as before. If smooth= 1 
			(currently only the values 0 and 1 are allowed), then TemporalRepair is no more 
			purely temporal, because it takes into account also the temporal fluctuation of 
			the 8 neighboring pixels.&nbsp;Consequently, TemporalRepair "repairs" less with <EM>
				smooth</EM>=1 than with <EM>smooth</EM>=0, but still the resulting 
			deinterlacer cannot pass the ticker tape test satisfactorily (though it is 
			better).&nbsp; Thus we have introduced smooth=2,3 in version 0.9 for this 
			purpose. Mode&nbsp;2 restores&nbsp;less than mode 0,1,3 and is therefore the 
			safest mode for deinterlacing and gives fairly good compression results. Mode 3 
			is also suitable for deinterlacing and should be chosen, if one aims to 
			preserve a maximum amount of detail. In the ticker tape test mode 2 performs 
			better than mode 3 and a lot better than mode 1, but it is still not artifact 
			free. However, it competes well with most other motion adaptive deinterlacers 
			(usually threshold based) in this test. One has to remove the remaining 
			artifacts by another application of RemoveGrain. In this way one gets the 
			following deinterlacer:
		</P>

			<TABLE id="Table8" bgColor="#b6c0ca" border="1">

					</TD>
				</TR>
			</TABLE>
		</P>
		<P>However, this deinterlacer obviously no more adheres to the no motion no change

		<P>This version of RGDeinterlace is again no motion no change and performs better

			which always results in&nbsp;rather poor compression, because the two fields 
			are too different (this can be nicely displayed with a sharpener).
			<H2><FONT size="6">Faster Processing of Black&amp;White Video</FONT></H2>
		<P>Clense and TemporalRepair both have the optional <EM>grey</EM> variable. If <EM>grey</EM>=

		<H2><FONT size="6">Color Spaces</FONT></H2>
		<P>Until version 0.7 the above filters did also support the color spaces YUY2, 
			RGB24 and RGB32. It did so by converting these interleaved formats internally 
			into a planar ones, then the planar intemediate formats were processed as YV12 
			and finally the intermediate planar formats were converted back into the 
			original interleaved formats. If ,as in some of the above scripts, many 
			instances of the above filters are used, these conversion routines resulted in 
			enormous overhead. Also the conversion routines were not optimised. Beginning 
			with verison 0.8 we have dropped support for the interleaved color spaces in 
			favor of their planar analogs. For Avisynth planar YUY2, RGB24 or RGB32 frames 
			look just like the ordinary interleaved frames of these color spaces. However, 
			the organization of the data on these frames is very different. The not yet 
			released plugin SSETools (preliminary versions are included in the RemoveGrain 
			package) contains the basic filters Interleaved2Planar and Planar2Interleaved. 
			For YV12 these filters do absolutely nothing. For the other color spaces, 
			Interleaved2Planar converts the interleaved frames into frames with planar data 
			organisation and Planar2Interleaved reverses this conversion. Thus 
			Interleaved2Planar().Planar2Interleaved and 
			Planar2Interleaved.Interleaved2Planar(). leaves any frame unchanged. Thus 
			Planar2Interleaved and Interleaved2Planar are lossless filters. For YUY2 the 
			filters&nbsp;&nbsp;Interleaved2Planar() and Planar2Interleaved are highly 
			optimised and shouldn't cost much more than a simple bitblt. Now, in order to 
			prohibit unexperienced users from applying the above filters to interleaved 
			color spaces, we have added the boolean variable <EM>planar</EM> to 
			RemoveGrain, Repair and TemporalRepair. If <EM>planar</EM>=false (the default 
			value), then these filters reject YUY2, RGB24 and RGB32 frames. Only if <EM>planar</EM>=true, 
			then these filters accept YUY2, RGB24 and RGB32 input, but always assume that 
			the data are organised in a planar way. If you use <EM>planar</EM>=true with 
			ordinary interleaved input, you get garbage. Clense and MCClense like most 
			other purely temporal filters work the same way with planar and interleaved 
			input. Thus these filters have no<EM> planar</EM> variable and work both with 
			planar and interleaved input. TemporalRepair(smooth=0) is also purely temporal 
			and thus accepts YUY2, RGB24 and RGB32 input even with <EM>planar</EM>=false. 
			On the other hand,TemporalRepair(smooth=1) has also spatial aspects and 
			therefore rejects any YUY2, RGB24 and RGB32 input with <EM>planar</EM>=false. 
			In the not too distant future there should be a web site <A href="http://www.PlanarYUY2.de.tf">
				www.PlanarYUY2.de.tf</A> , which will list filters and there compatibility 
			with planar YUY2, RGB24, RGB32.
