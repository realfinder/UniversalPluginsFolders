	<h1>ResampleHQ kernel visualizations</h1>
	<p>
		This page attempts to visualize various resampling kernels in a way that will help to you
		choose which one is right for you.  There is no "best" kernel -- they all have their uses and
		the right one for will depend greatly on both the source and personal preference.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Start off with a common choice, like Mitchell-Netravali or Lanczos3.  If it doesn't look
		acceptible, compare them with other kernels on the graphs to find one that has better
		properties in the area you wish to improve.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The X axis represents the distance between the optimal sample location and the actual sample
		location.  A dead-on hit would be at 0.0, while a hit one pixel away would be 1.0, and so on.
		Note that kernels can take multiple samples.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The Y axis represents the weight applied to the sample at that distance.  Note that most
		kernels have negative weights at some distances.
	</p>

		Here are some of my own observations:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Blurring</b> occurs if there is a positive bias.  Look at Bilinear as a base&mdash;any
			other kernels with weights higher than it introduce a positive bias that must be removed
			with negative weights.  <b>SoftCubic100</b> doesn't remove the positive bias, so is very
			blurry.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Sharpness</b> is proportional to the sample count and total absolute weight.
			<b>Bilinear</b> is the least sharp, even though it is not blurry.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Ringing</b> is proportional to negative weight.  <b>Lanczos4</b> will cause a lot of
			ringing.
		</li>
	</ul>
