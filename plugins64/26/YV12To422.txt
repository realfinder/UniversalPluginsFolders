#YV12To422
## YV12 to YV16YUY2 converter for AviSynth2.6

YV12To422 is an avisynth filter plugin which based on YV12ToYUY2(ddcc.dll)
written by Kevin Stone(a.k.a tritical) and was written from scratch.

###Info
    Convert YV12 clip to YV16YUY2 using SSE2AVX2.

    version 1.0.2


### Requirement
    - avisynth2.60avisynth+r1576 or later.
    - SSE2 capable CPU.
    - WindowsVista sp2 or later.
    - Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013.

### Syntax

    YV12To422(clip, bool interlaced, int itype, int cplace, bool lshift,
              bool yuy2, bool avx2, bool threads, float b, float c)


    NOTE these parameters may be changed later.
          (Sorry, I'm not enthusiastic about keeping backward compatibility.)


####    interlaced -

      Sets whether or not the input video is interlaced or progressive.

      default  false


####    itype -

      Sets interpolation method. Possible settings

          0 - duplicate (nearest neighbor)
          1 - linear interpolation
          2 - Mitchell-Netravali two-part cubic interpolation
                 (adjustable bc parameters to adjust blurringringing)

      default  2


####    cplace -

      Specifies vertical chroma placement.  Possible settings

        progressive input (interlaced=false, progressive upsampling)

            0 - chroma is aligned with top line of each two line pair within the frame

                This would be the case if during 422 - 420 conversion the chroma values of
                odd lines were simply dropped.

            1 - chroma is centered between lines of each two line pair within the frame
                ( h261, h263, mpeg1, mpeg2, mpeg4, h264 standard progressive conversion)

                This would be the case if during 422 - 420 conversion the chroma from every
                two line pair was averaged, or if an interlaced 422 - 420 conversion was performed
                by using 7525 averaging of top field pairs and 2575 averaging of bottom field pairs.

            2 - chroma is aligned with top line of each two line pair within each field

                This would be the case if the 422 - 420 conversion was performed by
                separating the fields, and then doing a 422 - 420 conversion on each field
                by dropping odd line chroma values.

            3 - chroma is centered between lines of each two line pair within each field

                This would be the case if the 422 - 420 conversion was performed by
                separating the fields, and then doing a 422 - 420 conversion on each field
                by averaging chroma from every two line pair.

        interlaced input (interlaced=true, interlaced upsampling)

            0 - chroma is aligned with top line of each two line pair within each field

                This would be the case if the 422 - 420 conversion was performed by
                separating the fields, and then doing a 422 - 420 conversion on each field
                by dropping odd line chroma values.

            1 - chroma is centered between lines of each two line pair within each field

                This would be the case if the 422 - 420 conversion was performed by
                separating the fields, and then doing a 422 - 420 conversion on each field
                by averaging chroma from every two line pair.

            2 - top field chroma is 14 pixel below even lines in the top field, and
                bottom field chroma is 14 pixel above odd lines in the bottom field.
                ( mpeg2, mpeg4, h264 standard interlaced conversion)

                This would be the case if the 422 - 420 conversion was performed by
                averaging top field pairs using 7525 weighting, and averaging bottom field
                pairs using 2575 weighting.  This results in the same chroma placement as
                progressive cplace option 1.

            3 - U is aligned with top line of each two line pair within each field, and
                V is aligned with bottom line of each pair within each field.
                ( DV-PAL standerd interlaced conversion)

         Progressive option 1 and interlaced option 2 are actually the same in terms of
           chroma placement.  If a progressive frame was converted to yv12 using interlaced
           method 2, then it is safe (actually better) to convert it to yuy2 using progressive
           method 1.  However, if a progressive frame was converted to yv12 using a different
           type of interlaced sampling, resulting in different chroma placement (such as those
           described by interlaced options 0 or 1), then it is best to convert it to yv16yuy2
           using progressive upsampling, but with the cplace option that correctly specifies
           the positioning of the chroma.

      default  1 (if interlaced = false)
                2 (if interlaced = true)


####    lshift -

      If set this to true, chroma placement will shift to 14 sample to the left.

        default false


####    yuy2 -

      Sets whether or not the output video format is packed(YUY2) or planar(YV16).

      defaullt true (YUY2 output)


####    avx2 -

      Sets whether AVX2 is used or not.

      default false (use SSE2)

         Currentry, avisynth2.60 can't make memory alignment anything but 16bytes.
           Thus, if you use avisynth2.60, you shouldn't to set this true.
           avisynth+ has no problem.
           see httpsgithub.comAviSynthAviSynthPluscommitab4ea303b4ca78620c2ef90fdaad184bc18b7708


####    threads -

      When sets this to true, V-plain is processed with a different thread at the
      same time with U-plain.
      However, processing doesn't always become speedy by this.

      default false (use single thread)


####    b  c -

      Adjusts properties of cubic interpolation (itype=2).  Same as Avisynth's BicubicResize filter.

      default  0.0,0.75
